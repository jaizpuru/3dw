# 3dw
A viewport into the computer

3dw consists of two parts: 
- A web service that relies on a Microsoft Kinect device to track the position of the viewer's head, relative to the screen.
- A WebGL aplication that renders a simple 3D scene, and adjusts the position and perspective of the camera so it matches the viewer.

The result can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/IdhcgrISiIk).
